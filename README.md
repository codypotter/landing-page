# LandingPage

This is my personal landing page, an incredibly small angular SPA. It provides links to stuff I want you to see.

## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Deploy

Authenticate with AWS, then run `npm deploy`. You will see errors if project components are misconfigured in AWS.
