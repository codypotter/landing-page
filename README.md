# LandingPage

This is my personal landing page, an incredibly small angular SPA. It provides links to stuff I want you to see.

## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Deploy

The deployment process is automated using GitHub Actions, AWS S3, and CloudFront.

### Versioning

Changes are merged into main via pull requests. A new version tag is created automatically whenever a PR is merged.

### Release/Deploy

Deployment is triggered by creating a Release in GitHub.
